## Prevention and mitigation
Key defensive measures to prevent password mismanagement:

### Use third-party service providers (like Auth0)
It's secure way to store credentials. It offlads the complexity of authentication management to a trusted entity and makes it convinient for users.
  OAuth is an authorization protocol that allows a user to grant third-party app limited access to their resources without sharing their credentials.

Allows users to keep control of their identity data.
